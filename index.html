					<h3>Why Vehicles?</h3>

					<p>
					Vehicles have always been something I have had a high interest in, since I was a little girl.  Not just cars, but trucks, tractors, lawn mowers and pretty much anything else with wheels.  My parents had a passion for high performance sports cars and off-road vehicles.  My grandparents in Greece who owned an olive farm a nd manufactured olive oil had tractors and other farm equipment.
					</p>

					<p>
					As I grew up I realized that you can tell a lot about me at a certain point of time just by what I was driving.  Each vehicle taught me a different life lesson.  Each vehicle helped me through a different transitional period in my life.  Most of all, I had a love for each vehicle, not because it was a possession, but because each one was a catalyst in making me who I am now.

					<h3>Reflect For Yourself</h3>

					<p>
					As you learn my story through my vehicles, reflect on your own experiences.  How have you grown through your vehicles, maybe you have had the same vehicle from the start.  That in itself tells a lot about you and your story.
					</p>

					<p>
					Perhaps your growth isn't shown through your vehicle, but something else.  What could that something else be?  For some people it is different homes they have lived in, pieces of artwork they have created, fashion style transitions, maybe even significant other changes.
					</p>

					<p>
					We all have a story and we can all represent it in our own way.  I am not one with words on their own.  If you ask me to represent my life through pictures or my own creations then I can explain things to you better.  So here we are...

								</p>
								<p>Henry was built with the greatest diesel motor ever made - the 7.3 liter International Harvester Turbo Diesel.  When I bought Henry he had over 300,000 miles on him, was stock and the cab had about 3" thick of dirt under the vinyl flooring because he was a hard working truck.  I could (should) have left Henry stock, but I spent a year rebuilding him.  Once I did all the mods listed below I would put the chip to performance mode all the time and one day I blew Henry's motor up.  This was one of my saddest days.  I will never forget what it sounded like and what it smelled like (Chinese food).  It was back to the drawing board, but this gave me the opportunity to put in a totally rebuilt 7.3 motor so it was almost like Henry had 0 miles on him.  Over the year I learned a lot about diesel motors and was able to do some creative side projects (like make a wind chime out of his bent rods).  The day I put Henry up for sale someone bought him.  I didn't think he would go so soon especially for what I was asking, but it was time to move on because I spent all my free time researching and working on him.  King Henry will always be my first love.

							<button class="accordion">Posydon</button>
							<div class="panel">

								<p>
								Named after the almighty King of the Sea because of his strong, long, blue presence.  Here he is located at his home, New Smyrna Beach, FL.  Although Posydon was a newer diesel, he still made some noise.  This truck helped my parents move out into their new home and me move into mine.  It helped construct many new landscaping endeavours by hauling sod and mulch.  He would even have a ton or two of rocks dumped into the bed for bigger landscape jobs.  Posydon was a hard worker but also could have a good time.  One of my favorite things to do with him was put the exhaust brake on so that it would sound like a dump truck downshifting.
								</p>

								<p>
								PS - that little wiener dog is Turbo, his full name is Turbo Diesel.  He loves riding in trucks and has been doing it since he was a little baby.  Turbo is my best friend.  He loves all the same things as I do!

								<p>
								Phanta is named after the Orange Soda, "Fanta", but she spells it with a P-H because she is PHAT.  This is the first car I ever owned.  Posydon was traded in because I just bought a house and really needed to save  more money.  The Dodge Charger is the only vehicle I liked that would be able to help me do this.  Although Phanta may be a bit slow because she only has a V6, she still looks good.  People often confuse her color with red, but her actual color is 'Go Mango'.  She is registered as an orange vehicle.  Phanta has done her share of transporting sod also.  No complaints so far!  As Young Jeezy said, ".. in my black and oragne charger, call it trick or treat."
